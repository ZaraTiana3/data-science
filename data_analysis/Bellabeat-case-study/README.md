<h1>Bellabeat Case study </h1>
This is a  Google Data Analytics Capstone: a case study from an online course provided by Coursera. The goal of the project is to perform an analysis.

<h2>Context: </h2>
Urška Sršen and Sando Mur founded Bellabeat, a high-tech company that manufactures health-focused sma products. Sršen used her background as an aist to develop beautifully designed technology that informs and inspires women around the world. Collecting data on activity, sleep, stress, and reproductive health has allowed Bellabeat to empower women with knowledge about their own health and habits. Since it was founded in 2013, Bellabeat has grown rapidly and quickly positioned itself as a tech-driven wellness company for women; By 2016, Bellabeat had opened oces around the world and launched multiple products. Bellabeat products became available through a growing number of online retailers in addition to their own e-commerce channel on their website. The company has invested in traditional adveising media, such as radio, out-of-home billboards, print, and television, but focuses on digital marketing extensively. Sršen knows that an analysis of Bellabeat’s available consumer data would reveal more oppounities for growth. She has asked the marketing analytics team to focus on a Bellabeat product and analyze sma device usage data in order to gain insight into how people are already using their smart devices. Then, using this information, she would like high-level recommendations for how these trends can inform Bellabeat marketing strategy.
