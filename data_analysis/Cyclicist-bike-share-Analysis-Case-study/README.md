<h1>Cyclicist_bike_share </h1> 
This is a Google Data Analytics Capstone: a case study from an online course provided by Coursera. The goal of the project is to perform an analysis.
<h2>Context: </h2>

In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share program. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system at any time.

Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that contributed to this success was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships.

Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders, while customers who purchase annual memberships are called Cyclistic members. Cyclistic’s financial analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders.

Moreno has set a clear goal: design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. To achieve this, the team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ, why casual riders might choose to buy a membership, and how digital media could influence their marketing tactics.

Moreno and her team are interested in analyzing Cyclistic's historical bike trip data to identify trends.

The analysis is divided into 6 phases: 
<ul>
  <li><strong>Ask:</strong> Define the business task and identify key stakeholders </li>
  <li><strong>Prepare:</strong>  Review the organization and the licensing of the data </li>
  <li><strong>Process:</strong> to clean the data</li>
  <li><strong>Analyze:</strong> Examine the data to identify patterns and trends </li>
  <li><strong>Share:</strong> Present the insights found during the analysis </li>
  <li><strong>Act:</strong> Provide recommendations based on the analysis </li>
</ul>
